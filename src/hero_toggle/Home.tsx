      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I am currently in my final year pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, 
        with a CGPA of 9.42. Over the past few years, I have developed a passion for software development, web technologies, and cloud computing.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My experience includes working as a Product Engineer at ReelsNShorts, where I designed landing and dashboard pages using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and at Think Digital, where I have honed my skills as both a Web Developer and Content Writer. In these roles, I have not only built web applications but also led teams and mentored juniors, which helped increase user engagement and retention significantly.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I have strong proficiency in technologies like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js, among others. I have also worked on several exciting projects, including an Airbnb website clone, a celebrity fact platform, and an AI-powered brain cancer detection tool.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’m deeply passionate about problem-solving and continually advancing my technical skill set. As someone who has actively participated in hackathons and competitions such as the Smart India Hackathon and IOCL Sustainathon, I enjoy taking on challenges and learning something new every day.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Whether working individually or collaborating in teams, I am driven by the desire to create impactful solutions. I’m excited to continue my journey, grow professionally, and make a significant difference through technology.
